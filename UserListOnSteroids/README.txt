Hey there!

This script produces a list of all domain users in all of your servers.

----------********In order to use the program you will first need to run the configureClient.bat file on your pc, move the content of "server side" dirctory to each server and execute configureServer.bat on each of the servers you want to check.********----------

How to use:
1. Edit the "databasa.txt" file and write inside the ip and password for each "Administrator" account in the following format:

123.123.123.123|pa$$word
123.123.123.124|pa$$word
123.123.123.125|pa$$word

where "123.123.123.123" is the public ip for one of the servers and "pa$$word" is the Administrator's password.

2. Double click the RUN.bat file.

3. The report will be generated in the app's directory as REPORT.txt
